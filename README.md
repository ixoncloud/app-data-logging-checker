# Data Logging Checker

The **Data Logging Checker** is a tool used to check the data logging status of your fleet as a whole, as it provides a sortable overview of every agent in your company, helping you checking two critical things instantly: connectivity status and data logging configuration.

## Use cases

When managing a large fleet, it's difficult to know if all agents are correctly configured and online.

The **Data Logging Checker** can be used in different use cases, including the following: 

- To identify agents that **have been offline for months**, that still cost money and that clutter your dashboard.

- To identify agents that are online but **have 0 tags configured** and are not logging any data, defeating their purpose.

- To quickly check your whole fleet and, by **clicking on the Agent's ID**, to navigate to the configuration page of the agent.

## Key Features

**Full Fleet Overview:** loads all agents in your company into one high-performance, scrollable table.

**Connectivity Status:** see the real-time Online or Offline **status** for every agent.

**"Last Seen Online" Date:** for offline agents, see the exact date and time they were last connected, helping you identify agents that have been **offline for days, weeks, or even months.**

**Tag Count:** instantly see the **total number of data tags configured** for each agent. This makes it easy to spot agents that have 0 tags and need configuration.

**Clickable Agent ID:** the agent ID for every row is a direct **hyperlink to that agent's configuration page** in the Fleet Manager, allowing you to take immediate action.

**Customizable Title:** set your own **title** for your company or fleet in the dashboard settings.

**Advanced Multi-Column Sorting:** filter the columns based on your needs.

## How to Use

- **Install** the Data Logging Checker component to your company from the marketplace.

- Navigate to the **Studio** and add the component to your page.

- (Optional) In the component settings, provide a **Title** (e.g., "Main Fleet Health").

The details of the fleet will load immediately.
